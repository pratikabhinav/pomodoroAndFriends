Pomodoro and friends
------------

This is a Chrome extension that runs a Pomodoro timer discretely in the chrome extensions toolbar. Upon completion of a pomodoro, it plays a sound and sends out a notification with two options to choose from : <br>
<ol> Take a break
<ol> Continue Working
<br>
A custom timer and a 50-10 timer is also available.
